I finally got around to making the latest changes to my blog setup, so now I can push it!


My blog is a customized version of [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) containing a few tweaks that I find make it easier to publish on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). If you want to try it out yourself, it is on [rolk/jekyll-bootstrap](http://github.com/rolk/jekyll-bootstrap).
